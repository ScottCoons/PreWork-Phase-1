    <h1>Pre-Work Phase 1</h1>
    <p>Git is version control software that we run on our computer.</p>
    <p>Git Hub is a remote web application that works with Git to help us collaborate and share our code with others.</p>
    <p>ddc-web-student.cnm.edu is the bootcamp server that runs our code.</p>
    <p>We add and commit our code to Git on our computer.</p>
    <p>We <a href="https://youtu.be/vCadcBR95oU" target="_blank">PUSH</a> our code from our computer to GitHub.</p>
    <p>We DEPLOY our code from our computer to the bootcamp server.</p>
    <p>DEPLOY and PUSH are different.</p>
